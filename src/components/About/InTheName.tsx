          Let's Talk Real - We know that these conversations are going to be
          hard, they are going to get real and they are going to challenge all

          Let's Talk Reconciliation - We were given the ministry of

          When Jesus encountered the Samaritan woman at the well, they talked.
          As he was sitting around the table at Mary and Martha's, they talked.
          His apostles approached him many times about hard things and things
          that were on their mind, and they talked. A woman snuck up and touched
          the garment of Jesus. He was compelled to talk to her even though she
          had already been healed. It wasnt enough for Zacchaeus to see him in
          the tree, Jesus wanted to go to his house and talk. Jesus even talked
          with his Mom.

          A conversation is one of the most intimate encounters we have with
          people. It doesn't just include talking but more importantly
          listening. Listening, real listening, is an act of dying to self where
          we set our ego aside and sacrificially empty ourselves to hear our
          neighbor. Learning to have the hard conversations is a sacrificial act
          of love.
